Hi Iâ€™m **Fengxiang Zhao**. Currently, I am Ph.D. student at University Missouri supervised by Professor [Shang Yi](https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/yi-shang/). 

My research interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically in the area of building an intelligent survey system. I have an active interest in both theoretical issues and practical applications. I am currently working on [TigerAware](https://tigeraware.com/), a cross-platform system for collecting information from participants via smartphones in real life over time. In addition, I am working on modeling the knowledge in Ecological Momentary Assessment area, which will facilitate researching in different areas (psychology, sociology, etc.). I have many expertises including Java, Python, Web Development, Android Development. I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science from Case Western Reserve University in 2019.

Lover of innovation and everything related to generate new knowledge. Face problems with a smile and solve them as soon as possible. Very calculated about the time I spend and work I do.
